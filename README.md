Mancala is a two player game that is played with a board and several stones.

Setup:
Players sit on either side of the board. Each player has six bowls and one mancala. Before play begins, four stones are placed into each bowl, while both mancalas are left empty. The object of the game is for a player to collect the most stones in his/her mancala.

Rules:
Play begins by randomly choosing a player to move first. The first player picks up all of the stones in one of his/her bowls. The player then drops one stone into the bowl to the left or the right of the current bowl and continues to move to each bowl sequentially, dropping a stone into each, until no more stones remain in hand. Once a direction counter-clockwise, the player must continue moving in that direction for the duration of the turn. If a player passes by his/her own mancala, a stone is dropped into it. The opponent's mancala, however, is simply ignored. (A player never drops a stone into the opponent's mancala.) If stones still remain in the player's hand after reaching a mancala, players continue moving around to the opposite side of the board (in a circular fashion).
If the last stone a player drops during a turn lands in his/her own mancala, then the player immediately takes another turn.
If a player drops the last stone into one of his/her empty bowls (on the correct side of the board), then that last stone, plus all the stones in the opponent's corresponding bowl, are collected and placed in the player's mancala “Stealing Mode”
